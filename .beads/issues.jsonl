Returns id, content, section, title, part, volume, applicable_classes, similarity. Uses cosine distance `1 - (embedding \u003c=\u003e query_embedding)`.\n- RLS enabled: only policy is `Allow anon read access` (SELECT for anon role). NO INSERT policy exists.\n\n### Environment\n- `/Users/fraserbrown/Documents/Programming/buildscope/.env` has SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY\n- `.env` does NOT have SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (only the .env.example has the placeholder)\n- No `ingestion/` directory exists yet -- needs to be created\n\n## Implementation Guidance\n\n### Chunking Strategy (use TOC, not regex on raw text)\n- `doc.get_toc()` returns `[(level, title, page), ...]` -- 208 L3 entries define every clause boundary\n- For each L3 entry, extract text from its start page to the next L3 entry start page\n- Within that page range, locate the section ID in text to find the exact start position (section IDs appear as ` {ID}\\n` with leading space)\n- Strip the 3-line page header (`{section_name}\\nNCC 2022...\\nPage {N}`) and footer `(1 May 2023)` from each page before concatenation\n- Strip the `[2019: ...]` or `[New for 2022]` reference lines from chunk content (these are version annotations, not NCC content)\n- Part ID can be derived from the TOC hierarchy: track the current L2 entry when iterating\n\n### Regex Patterns for Text Cleanup\n- Page header: `r\"^.+\\nNCC 2022 Volume Two - Building Code of Australia\\nPage \\d+\\n\"` (first 3 lines of each page)\n- Page footer: `r\"\\(1 May 2023\\)\\s*$\"` (last line of each page)\n- Section ID line: `r\"^\\s*([A-Z]\\d+[A-Z]+\\d+)\\s*$\"` (line containing only the section ID)\n- Section title line: follows immediately after section ID line\n- Version annotation: `r\"^\\[(?:2019|New for 2022):.+\\]\\s*$\"` (reference to previous NCC version)\n- State annotation inline: `r\"^(?:NSW|VIC|QLD|SA|WA|TAS|NT|ACT)\\s+[A-Z]\\d+[A-Z]+\\d+.*$\"` (state-specific flags in main text)\n- Bullet points appear as separate `\\u2022` lines (the bullet char is on a line by itself after the bullet text in PyMuPDF output)\n\n### Section ID Patterns\n- Main sections: `[A-Z]\\d+[A-Z]+\\d+` -- letter(A/H) + part number + type letter(G/O/F/P/V/D) + clause number\n  - G = Governing requirement, O = Objective, F = Functional Statement, P = Performance Requirement, V = Verification Method, D = Deemed-to-Satisfy\n- Specifications: `S\\d+C\\d+` -- S + spec number + C + clause number\n- State-prefixed: `(NSW|VIC|QLD|SA|WA|TAS|NT|ACT)\\s+[A-Z]\\d+[A-Z]+\\d+`\n\n### Building Class Detection (Volume 2)\n- All Volume 2 content applies to classes 1 and 10 by default (per spec)\n- The plan says: \"Volume 2 sections default to classes [1, 10]\"\n- State appendix content should set state_specific=true\n\n### Gemini text-embedding-004 API\n- Use `google-genai` Python SDK (package: `google-genai`)\n- Call: `client.models.embed_content(model=\"text-embedding-004\", contents=[list_of_strings], config=types.EmbedContentConfig(output_dimensionality=768))`\n- Accepts a list of strings for batch embedding in a single call\n- Batch limit per request: up to 250 texts or 20,000 tokens total per call (Vertex AI docs)\n- Free tier rate limits: ~1,500 RPM; plan says batches of 20 with 0.5s delay which is very conservative and safe\n- Returns `response.embeddings[i].values` (list of floats, 768 dims when configured)\n- Note: newer `gemini-embedding-001` exists but plan specifies `text-embedding-004` -- stick with plan\n\n### Supabase Bulk Insert\n- `supabase.table(\"ncc_chunks\").insert([list_of_dicts]).execute()` for bulk insert\n- Each dict needs: content, embedding (list of 768 floats), volume, part, section, title, applicable_classes, state_specific\n- Do NOT include `id` (it is IDENTITY ALWAYS -- auto-generated, cannot be set)\n- Do NOT include `created_at` (has default)\n- Plan says batches of 50 rows per insert call\n\n### RLS Blocker\n- The table has RLS enabled with ONLY a SELECT policy for anon role\n- The anon key in .env CANNOT insert data\n- The service role key is NOT in .env (only placeholder in .env.example)\n- Options: (a) add service role key to .env, (b) add an INSERT policy for service_role, or (c) the ingestion script needs SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY env var\n- The supabase-py client created with the service role key bypasses RLS\n\n## Risks\n\n### BLOCKER: No INSERT access\n- RLS only has anon SELECT policy. No service role key in .env. The ingestion script cannot insert data without one of: (a) adding SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to .env (get from Supabase dashboard \u003e Settings \u003e API), or (b) adding an RLS INSERT policy. Builder should add the service role key to .env and .env.example, and use it for the supabase client in the ingestion script.\n\n### Mathematical Formula Pages (p.83-84)\n- H1V1 (Structural reliability) and H1V2 contain formulas that PyMuPDF extracts as garbled Unicode symbols. These chunks will have low-quality text. Acceptable for POC -- flag but do not block.\n\n### Table Extraction Quality\n- 35 pages have tables. PyMuPDF text extraction may produce poorly formatted table content. For POC this is acceptable but some chunks will be noisy.\n\n### State Appendix Structure\n- State-specific content (p.216-312) is not in L3 TOC entries -- it is at L2 level with different structure (inline modifications). For POC, these can be chunked as larger blocks per state schedule page range, with state_specific=true. Alternatively, skip state appendices entirely for POC and focus on Sections A and H only.\n\n### Long Sections Needing Splitting\n- 23 sections span 2+ pages. H1D6 (Framing) is 7 pages (~14K chars). The \u003e2000 char splitting at paragraph boundaries is needed for these. Use double-newline as paragraph boundary.","created_at":"2026-02-20T02:16:57Z"},{"id":3,"issue_id":"buildscope-tde.1.2","author":"thebrownproject","text":"[BUILDER] NCC Volume 2 ingestion script complete. 363 chunks ingested to Supabase.\n\n## Files Changed\n- ingestion/ingest.py (created) -- full ingestion pipeline\n- ingestion/requirements.txt (created) -- pymupdf, supabase, google-genai, python-dotenv, tqdm\n\n## Tests Checklist\n- [x] Script runs without errors on NCC PDF\n- [x] Chunks have correct volume (2) based on PDF source\n- [x] Section IDs match NCC format (208 unique: A1G1, H1D3, S42C1, etc.)\n- [x] Each chunk has a 768-dimension embedding (gemini-embedding-001)\n- [x] Dry-run mode prints chunks without calling APIs\n- [x] Data appears in Supabase ncc_chunks table (363 rows)\n- [x] match_ncc_chunks returns relevant results for test queries (ceiling height -\u003e H4F2 at 0.735, egress -\u003e A6G2 at 0.694)\n\n## Key Details\n- Used gemini-embedding-001 (not text-embedding-004 which is deprecated/removed from API)\n- TOC-based chunking with hair-space section ID markers for precise within-page splitting\n- 208 unique sections, 363 total chunks (long sections split at paragraph boundaries)\n- Average chunk size 1016 chars, max 2000 chars, min 42 chars\n- Rate limit retry logic handles Gemini free tier 429s with exponential backoff\n- State appendices (Schedules 4-11, p.216-312) skipped per POC scope\n- Schedules 1-3 (definitions/references) excluded from chunking","created_at":"2026-02-20T02:29:51Z"}]}

{"id":"buildscope-tde.1.7","title":"Wire up end-to-end chat flow","description":"**Goal:** Connect all pieces: ChatPanel sends questions with project context to BuildScopeService, renders responses with markdown and references, manages per-project session memory, handles project switching and errors.\n\n**Files:**\n- Modify: Views/ChatPanel.xaml.cs, Services/BuildScopeService.cs\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Wire send button: add user message, show loading, call BuildScopeService.QueryAsync\n2. On response: remove loading, add assistant message with references, auto-scroll\n3. Per-project chat memory: Dictionary\u003cstring, ObservableCollection\u003cChatMessage\u003e\u003e, cap 20 messages\n4. Project switching: load project chat or show welcome\n5. Error handling: missing config, network errors, empty results\n6. Send chat history (last 10 messages) with each request\n7. Test full loop: create project -\u003e ask question -\u003e get answer -\u003e follow-up\n\n**Tests:**\n- [ ] Question sends to Edge Function with correct context\n- [ ] Response renders with answer and references\n- [ ] 20-message cap with FIFO eviction\n- [ ] Project switching loads correct chat\n- [ ] Missing config shows helpful error\n- [ ] Network errors display gracefully\n- [ ] Full loop works end-to-end","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"fraserbrown@live.com","created_at":"2026-02-20T11:07:17.767141+11:00","created_by":"thebrownproject","updated_at":"2026-02-20T11:07:17.767141+11:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"buildscope-tde.1.7","depends_on_id":"buildscope-tde.1","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-20T11:07:17.768434+11:00","created_by":"thebrownproject"},{"issue_id":"buildscope-tde.1.7","depends_on_id":"buildscope-tde.1.6","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-20T11:08:44.516187+11:00","created_by":"thebrownproject"}]}
